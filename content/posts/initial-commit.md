I have always wanted my own blog to share things that
I am learning, things I have learnt, or just ideas/thoughts.

Well here it is! Better late than never.

My current interests revolve around Svelte, GraphQL, Hasura,
Kubernetes, and Web Development. You can expect most of the
coming content to center on these topics.

However, I reserve the right to change my interests and the
topics I post about without notice. So watch this space!
